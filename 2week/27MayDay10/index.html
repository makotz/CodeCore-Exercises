    <p>
    not losing to the rain<br>
    not losing to the wind<br>
    not losing to the snow nor to summer's heat<br>
    with a strong body<br>
    not fettered by desire<br>
    by no means offending anyone<br>
    always quietly smiling<br>
    every day four bowls of brown rice<br>
    miso and some vegetables to eat<br>
    in everything<br>
    count yourself last and put others before you<br>
    watching and listening, and understanding<br>
    and never forgetting<br>
    in the shade of the woods of the pines of the fields<br>
    being in a little thatched hut<br>
    if there is a sick child to the east<br>
    going and nursing over them<br>
    if there is a tired mother to the west<br>
    going and shouldering her sheaf of rice<br>
    if there is someone near death to the south<br>
    going and saying there's no need to be afraid<br>
    if there is a quarrel or a lawsuit to the north<br>
    telling them to leave off with such waste<br>
    when there's drought, shedding tears of sympathy<br>
    when the summer's cold, wandering upset<br>
    called a nobody by everyone<br>
    without being praised<br>
    without being blamed<br>
    such a person<br>
    I want to become</p>
